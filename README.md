# COVID-19 Cases Analysis

## Project Overview
This project analyzes global COVID-19 cases using a dataset containing details such as **country**, **date**, **cases**, **recovered**, **deaths**, and **tests**. The goal of the project is to gain insights into the COVID-19 trends over time, including:

- Total cases and recovery rates.
- Daily trends of new cases, deaths, and recoveries.
- Regional comparison of case loads and death rates.
- Visualizations of the COVID-19 data across different countries.

The analysis involves the use of Python libraries like **pandas**, **NumPy**, and **Matplotlib** for data manipulation, calculations, and visualization.

## Features
- **Data Loading & Preprocessing**: Loading and cleaning COVID-19 data from a CSV file. Handle missing or inconsistent data.
- **Calculations**:
  - Total cases and total deaths.
  - Daily case change percentage.
  - Death rates across countries.
- **Visualization**:
  - Line charts to show daily trends of new cases, deaths, and recoveries.
  - Bar charts comparing total cases across regions.
  - Trend of death rates over time.
  - Regional comparison to identify the most affected countries.

## Technologies Used
- **Python**: Core language for the project.
- **pandas**: For data manipulation and analysis.
- **NumPy**: For numerical calculations like daily case changes and death rates.
- **Matplotlib**: For data visualization (plots and graphs).

## Dataset
The dataset used in this project contains the following columns:
- `Country`: The country name.
- `Date`: The date of the reported data.
- `Cases`: Total confirmed cases.
- `Recovered`: Total recovered cases.
- `Deaths`: Total deaths.
- `Tests`: Total tests conducted.
